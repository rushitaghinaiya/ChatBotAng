Development Notes:

Always add a .gitignore file before your first commit to prevent tracking unnecessary or sensitive files.


Never commit the following directories:

node_modules/ – Contains installed dependencies and can be recreated with npm install.

.angular/ – Contains Angular build caches and temporary files.

dist/ – Contains build output.


Never commit environment files that contain sensitive keys, such as:

environment.ts

environment.prod.ts

Any .env files

For example, do not commit files that contain secrets like:


export const environment = {
  production: false,
  openAiKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
};
Instead:

Store sensitive keys securely (e.g., environment variables or a secure vault).

Use .env files and add them to .gitignore:


# Ignore environment files
*.env
src/environments/*.ts
Share keys only through secure channels (never in source control).
